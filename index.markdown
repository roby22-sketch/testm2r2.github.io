## About Me

Hi! I am a third-year Mathematics/Pre-Medicine student at Texas Tech University. I started my time in research in January of 2023 in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics with [Dr. Travis Thompson](https://www.mathemology.com/stp.html). Our program aims to develop data-driven computational models of various biological processes. Most notably, we are interested in modeling cancer dynamics and neurodegenerative disease. 

I also work at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center with [Dr. Komaraiah Palle](https://www.ttuhsc.edu/medicine/cell-biology-biochemistry/faculty/palle.aspx). We are working to understand the key components related to chemo-resistance and carcinogenic processes.
